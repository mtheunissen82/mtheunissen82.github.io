[Yesterday I disabled my arrow navigation][1] in vim to practice **hjkl** navigation.
Already I am experiencing the need to expand this awesome navigation on different terain.  

This afternoon I was doing some rainy sunday browsing and randomly started pressing **j** and **k** in an attempt
to scroll my chrome window.  

I found a fine chrome extension called [vimium][2].

My personal favorites:  

**Navigation**  
**j** :	Scroll down  
**k** :	Scroll up  
**h** :	Scroll left  
**l** :	Scroll right  
**gg** : Scroll to the top of the page  
**G** :	Scroll to the bottom of the page  

**Finding**  
**/** : Enter find mode  
**n** : Jump to next find match    
**N** : Jump to previous find match  

**Other**  
**r** :	Reload the page  
**gs** : View page source  
**yy** : Copy current url  

And of course you can always press the **?** key to popup the vimium help dialog.
