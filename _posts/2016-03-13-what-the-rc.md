title: What the rc???

Many times i was wondering what "rc" from e.g. ~/.bash<b>rc</b> or /etc/<b>rc</b>.d exactly means.
Well, apparently it is a fossil from yeh old Unix days.  
The abbreviation "rc" stands for `runcom` which in turn is short for `run commands`.

Runcom was a facility from the MIT [Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS)][1],
one of the first time-sharing operating systems first demonstrated in 1961, that would run a number of commands from a file.  
This being cool and funky, the Unix grandfathers determined to adopt this for naming their scripts too.
