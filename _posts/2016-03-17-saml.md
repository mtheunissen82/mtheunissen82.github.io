[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0) is a abbreviation for Security Assertion Markup Language. SAML is a XML based protocol which is used to exchange authentication and authorization data between different [security domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_domain).

Involved parties:  
1) Identity Provider. Sometimes also called the *SAML authority*.  
2) Service Provider. Also known as the *SAML consumer*.  
3) Client. Typically a User-Agent who is requesting a protected resource at the SP.  

Diagrams which i found useful for clarifing the typical flow between the involved parties.
