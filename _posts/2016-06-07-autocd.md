After hammering my keyboard this morning with `cd blala`, `cd lala` and `cd something_else` i got tired of typing the cd builtin.  
I started googling if there was somekind of hacky solution to this problem and found that the great developers of bash already thought about this!


Behold the power of less is more:

> $ shopt -s autocd
