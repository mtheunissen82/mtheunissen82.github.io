A couple of days ago i stumbled across an awesome linux tool. I had to, recursively, rename a huge amount of files and directories. All these files and directories contained somekind of string which had to be replaced by some other string. `$ rename` substitute to the rescue!

So for example to *recursively* substitute all occurrences of 'foo' to 'bar' in the current path (use the -v switch to see what files are changed):
> $ rename -v 's/foo/bar/' **

He... you can even do a dry-run with the -n switch and see what files will be affected:

> $ rename -n 's/foo/bar/' **

Make sure you enable *globstar* to make the double ** work:
> $ shopt -s globstar

So after mentioning the good news... here is the bad news...  
There happen to be two flavours of this awesome tool, one being Perl-ish the other being C-ish.

RedHat distro's tend to go with a C-ish variant (from the [util-linux package][1]) and Debian distro's with a Perl-ish one.
The Perl-ish one is imho the "good" one since it supports the neat substitute functionality where you can use complex regex.

Actually Debian was so thoughtfull of installing them both. The Perl-ish one at /usr/bin/prename and the C-ish one at /usr/bin/rename.ul .

No worries to y'all RedHat addicts. You can easily install it with CPAN (Perl package manager):

> sudo yum install cpan  
> sudo cpan  
> cpan1> install File::Rename
